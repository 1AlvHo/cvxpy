# Player 1 wishes to choose u to minimize his expected payoff u'Pv, while
# player 2 wishes to choose v to maximize u'Pv, where P is the payoff
# matrix, u and v are the probability distributions of the choices of each
# player (i.e. u>=0, v>=0, sum(u_i)=1, sum(v_i)=1)
# LP formulation:   minimize    t
#                       s.t.    u >=0 , sum(u) = 1, P'*u <= t*1
#                   maximize    t
#                       s.t.    v >=0 , sum(v) = 1, P*v >= t*1

# Input data
n = 12
m = 12
P = cvxopt.normal(n,m)

# Variables for two players
x = Variable(n)
y = Variable(m)
t1 = Variable()
t2 = Variable()

# Note in one case we are maximizing; in the other we are minimizing
objective1 = Minimize(t1)
objective2 = Maximize(t2)

print 'Done!'

# Optimal strategy for Player 2

print x.value, y.value
print 'The expected payoffs for player 1 and player 2 respectively are: '
print result1, result2
print 'They are equal as expected!'
## ISSUE: THEY AREN'T EXACTLY EQUAL FOR SOME REASON!
