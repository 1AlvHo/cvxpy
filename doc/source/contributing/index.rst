Contributing
===============

We welcome all contributors to CVXPY. You don't need to be an expert in convex
to help out!  To get started as a CVXPY developer, install CVXPY from
:doc:`source </install/index>`. Contributions to CVXPY are made through pull
requests or feature branches to our `Github repository
<https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy>`_.  Our Github `issues
<https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy/issues>`_ page is the most up-to-date list of
CVXPY bugs and feature requests: feel free to tackle any of them.
 
The `cvxpy <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cvxpy>`_ mailing list is
for users and developers of CVXPY.  Use this mailing list to introduce
yourself.  You can also contact the project leads `Steven Diamond
<http://web.stanford.edu/~stevend2/>`_ and `Stephen Boyd
<http://stanford.edu/~boyd/>`_ directly.

When navigating the source, keep in mind that CVXPY is a work in progress. The
only APIs guaranteed to be stable are those discussed in the API documentation.
All other APIs are subject to change without warning.  Files that are certain
to change in the future are marked "DEPRECATED" in the source.
